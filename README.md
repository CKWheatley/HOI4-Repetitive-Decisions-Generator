# HOI4-Repetitive-Decisions-Generator
Generator that is useful for decisions that repeat code a lot similar to my Insane Upgrades Mod for HOI4. I suppose it can come in handy for people who have literally no idea how to mod as well lol


Ideally have a look into Jquery and Javascript Functions & Variables
Please make sure you have a basic understanding on how the hoi4 modding works.

/////////////////////////////////           INSTRUCTIONS           /////////////////////////////////////

Download Hoi4 decision generator file
Open the functions.js file with your chosen code editor. RECCOMENDED (At the very least get notepad++, it is really handy for these files and completely free)
read the instructions that are usually a different colour but if you use regular notepad they start with this ->  // Im am an instruction
once you are done remember to save your file and open the .html document
copy everything that loads on the webpage then paste it into the hoi4 file you wish to change or add to.
everytime you want to change just re-save your JS file and refresh the webpage it opened previously.


yes im aware the code aint clean but i will work on this in future.
